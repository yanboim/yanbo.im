Duckling is here!

Almost everything that [Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one) offers is available in Duckling in a more minimal design.

Additionally, the following features were added:

- Project documentation! Find a demo under [Docs](/docs/gettingstarted/).
- [Subprojects](/subprojects), a way to showcase a project's features.

Learn how to use Duckling for your own project website in the [docs](/docs/gettingstarted/).
